                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            When I was in elementary school, I wanted to be a YouTuber. I'd watch people play video games all day, and that's all I wanted 
                            to do. Eventually, that turned into just wanting to play video games for a living because I didn't like the idea of being in front 
                            of a camera. But that interest got me curious about how games were made, which led to an interest in coding. I took a coding class 
                            all four years of high school, and I liked it, but I didn't really know what I wanted to do with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I liked the idea of cybersecurity because of hackers in shows, but I didn't seriously think about it as a career until I got to 
                            Florida Poly. When I saw how many computer science and software engineering students there were—tons of people wanting to be game 
                            developers—it made me question if that's really what I wanted. I didn't like the idea of being a coder, sitting at a desk doing 
                            mundane tasks, adding feature after feature, working on one tiny piece of a much larger project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's what pushed me toward cybersecurity. It's all about puzzles—hacking into systems, figuring out ways to stop people from 
                            getting in, thinking about how to get around those measures. Attack vectors, networking, all of it. It's way more interesting than 
                            just writing code for someone else's project. I love the decision I made.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My background outside of tech isn't your typical path either—I was a competitive swimmer in high school, got my lifeguard 
                            certification at 16, and spent years teaching kids and adults how to swim as a Water Safety Instructor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked my way up to Head Lifeguard at Florida Poly, and during my time at the City of Lakeland, I noticed they were still 
                            managing lifeguard rotations with a dry erase board. It seemed like an obvious problem to solve, so I built a React web app 
                            to replace it. Unfortunately, when I graduated and left, the IT department didn't want to maintain it, so it never got fully 
                            implemented. But it taught me a lot about building real solutions for real problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've always been worried about the effects of working at a computer all day. I already need glasses from staring at screens 
                            and reading too many books without good lighting as a kid, so I figured I should be proactive about preventing carpal tunnel 
                            before it becomes a problem. I had some "custom" keyboards before—I'd spend time making them look, sound, and feel the way I wanted. 
                            But they were still QWERTY with the normal row-stagger layout. Then I saw a YouTube video where someone built their own split keyboard, 
                            and it completely changed how I thought about keyboards. I went down a rabbit hole learning about ortholinear layouts, custom keymaps, 
                            and how QWERTY and row-stagger were originally designed for typewriters to prevent keys from jamming—not for human hands. They're 
                            actually terrible ergonomically, but everyone got so used to them that it just became "normal" and no one really questions it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My friends Vineet and Jake had already built their own keyboards, so I knew I had people to ask for help. I'd picked up soldering 
                            at an IEEE workshop one day—showed up, did it, burned myself a couple times, but picked it up pretty easily with very little instruction. 
                            The thing is, you don't get to use soldering often because buying plain PCBs and all the components (transistors, capacitors, 
                            microcontrollers) gets really expensive. Usually, buying things pre-manufactured is cheaper. But I wanted to build my own keyboard 
                            partly to get better at soldering, and I had a lot of fun building everything myself, piece by piece—even when things didn't work 
                            right away and even when I'd burn myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I built a Corne split keyboard from scratch, dove into ZMK firmware, designed custom keymaps for my workflow, and got into 3D printing 
                            to make the case and a carrying case. It's one of my favorite projects because I fixed a potential problem before it even happened, 
                            and I got to practice a skill I don't usually get to use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right now, I'm working as an Embedded Cybersecurity Engineer at EveryPeer. I build embedded agents, work on WebRTC-based 
                            peer discovery systems, and contribute to backend stuff for network security. I'm ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity and 
                            currently studying for my Network+ certification.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A friend of mine, Joey, introduced me to Zettelkasten—basically a knowledge management system for organizing notes. 
                            I really like how it works. Instead of trying to write everything about a subject all at once, you just make small, 
                            atomic notes and link them together. For example, algebra shows up in both physics and calculus. Without Zettelkasten, 
                            I'd have to write the same algebra information in both the physics and calculus notes. With Zettelkasten, I just make 
                            one note on algebra and link to it from both. It's way more efficient, and it makes it easier to see how concepts connect.
