                    <h2>How It Started</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started swimming in 7th grade. Before that, I played a bunch of different sports at the YMCA and did little 
                        league baseball for a few seasons. By the end of my last baseball season, I was pretty tired of my dad always 
                        telling me to go outside and practice, so I decided to try something different—swimming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ended up joining the St. Cloud Aquatics team, and honestly, it was one of the best decisions I made. I met 
                        some of my closest friends through that team. What I liked about swimming was that it's an individual sport—you're 
                        competing against yourself and the clock. That pushed me to work harder than I ever did in team sports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The discipline I got from swimming carried over into everything else. I became a lifeguard at 16, got my Water 
                        Safety Instructor certification, taught kids and adults how to swim, and eventually became Head Lifeguard at 
                        Florida Poly. All of that started because I wanted to try something new in 7th grade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These times don't really mean much now since I'm out of high school, but I'm still pretty proud of what I was 
                        able to accomplish. Swimming taught me that if you keep showing up and putting in the work, you'll get better. 
                        That applies to pretty much everything—coding, building stuff, whatever.

                    <p>
                        After competing in high school, I got my lifeguard certification at 16 and eventually became a Water Safety Instructor. 
                        I spent a lot of time teaching kids and adults how to swim, which was a lot of fun. It's cool being able to teach 
                        people something that could literally save their life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked as a lifeguard for Florida Poly and the City of Lakeland. At Florida Poly, I became Head Lifeguard, 
                        which meant managing schedules, training new guards, and making sure everything ran smoothly. It taught me a lot 
                        about leadership and handling emergencies—stuff that's been useful even in my engineering work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I was working for the City of Lakeland, I noticed they were still using a dry erase board for scheduling rotations. 
                        It seemed inefficient, so I built the <a href="projects.html">Lifeguard Scheduling App</a> to replace it. It was a 
                        React app that let everyone check the schedule on their phones instead of having to look at the board. Unfortunately, 
                        when I left to graduate, IT didn't want to maintain it, so it never got fully implemented. But it was still a good 
                        learning experience.
