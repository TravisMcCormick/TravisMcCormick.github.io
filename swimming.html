                    <h2>How It Started</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started swimming in 7th grade. Before that, I played a bunch of different sports at the YMCA and did little 
                        league baseball for a few seasons. By the end of my last baseball season, I was pretty tired of my dad always 
                        telling me to go outside and practice, so I decided to try something different—swimming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I ended up joining the St. Cloud Aquatics team, and honestly, it was one of the best decisions I made. I met 
                        some of my closest friends through that team. What I liked about swimming was that it's an individual sport—you're 
                        competing against yourself and the clock. That pushed me to work harder than I ever did in team sports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The discipline I got from swimming carried over into everything else. I became a lifeguard at 16, got my Water 
                        Safety Instructor certification, taught kids and adults how to swim, and eventually became Head Lifeguard at 
                        Florida Poly. All of that started because I wanted to try something new in 7th grade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These times don't really mean much now since I'm out of high school, but I'm still pretty proud of what I was 
                        able to accomplish. Swimming taught me that if you keep showing up and putting in the work, you'll get better. 
                        That applies to pretty much everything—coding, building stuff, whatever.

                        Swimming didn't just stay in the pool—it shaped everything that came after. The discipline I learned from training 
                        carried over into lifeguarding, teaching, and eventually into engineering. When I saw an inefficiency at the City 
                        of Lakeland, I didn't just accept it—I built the <a href="projects.html">Lifeguard Scheduling App</a> to fix it. 
                        That same mindset applies to everything I do now: if something's broken, figure out how to build a better solution.
