TODO: Add your resume PDF

To complete your portfolio site:

1. Create or export your resume as a PDF
2. Name the file exactly: resume.pdf
3. Place it in the root directory (same location as index.html)
4. Delete this RESUME_PDF_TODO.txt file

The "Download PDF" button on your resume page (resume.html) is already 
configured to link to "resume.pdf" in the root directory.

Once you add the PDF file, visitors will be able to download your resume!
