                        <h2>My Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades. I can code, I can build things, and I love figuring out how to make things work better. 
                            My background isn't your typical path into cybersecurity—I started as a competitive swimmer in high school, got my lifeguard 
                            certification at 16, and spent years teaching kids and adults how to swim as a Water Safety Instructor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked my way up to Head Lifeguard at Florida Poly, and during my time at the City of Lakeland, I noticed they were still 
                            managing lifeguard rotations with a dry erase board. It seemed like an obvious problem to solve, so I built a React web app 
                            to replace it. Unfortunately, when I graduated and left, the IT department didn't want to maintain it, so it never got fully 
                            implemented. But it taught me a lot about building real solutions for real problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A while back, I started getting early signs of carpal tunnel from all the typing and coding. Instead of just dealing with it, 
                            I decided to build a custom ergonomic keyboard. I taught myself how to solder, built a Corne split keyboard from scratch, 
                            learned about ZMK firmware, and even got into 3D printing to make the case. It's one of my favorite projects because it 
                            solved a real problem I was having.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right now, I'm working as an Embedded Cybersecurity Engineer at EveryPeer. I build embedded agents, work on WebRTC-based 
                            peer discovery systems, and contribute to backend stuff for network security. I'm ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity and 
                            currently studying for my Network+ certification.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also maintain a Zettelkasten—basically a knowledge management system where I keep all my notes organized. It's easier to 
                            write one small note than trying to write everything about a subject all at once. Plus, it lets me link stuff together. 
                            Like, algebra is used in physics and calculus, but if you don't have a note on algebra, you'd have to write that information 
                            in both the physics and calculus sections. With Zettelkasten, I just link them. It's way more efficient.
