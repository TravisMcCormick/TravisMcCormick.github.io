# Travis McCormick - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site. I'm Travis McCormick, an Embedded Cybersecurity Engineer, and this is where I share my work, experience, and how to reach me.

## 🌐 Live Site

Visit my site at: [https://travismccormick.github.io](https://travismccormick.github.io)

## ✨ Highlights

- Multi-page design with smooth navigation
- Dark/Light mode toggle with saved preference (press `T`), defaults to dark
- Keyboard shortcuts for quick jumps (H/1=Home, A/2=About, P/3=Projects, R/4=Resume, S/5=Swimming, C/6=Contact)
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Clean, modern look with a royal blue palette
- Six core pages:
  - Home with section cards for quick access
  - About with my story, education, certifications, experience, and interests
  - Projects with featured project stories
  - Resume with interactive layout and PDF downloads
  - Swimming with my competitive background and achievements
  - Contact with all the ways to reach me

## 🎨 Customization Notes

- Headshot: `assets/headshot.jpg` (recommended 400–600px square). I block right-click/selection/drag on the hero image to discourage copying.
- Bio: I edit the "About Me" section in `index.html` when I want to update my story.
- Projects: I drop screenshots into `assets/` (e.g., `keyboard-corne.jpg`, `keyboard-case.jpg`, `alu-breadboard.jpg`) and reference them on the Projects page.

## 🛠️ Technologies I Use
